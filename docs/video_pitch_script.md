 0:00 – 0:20 — Hook (Grab Attention)

Hi, I’m Ananya B Pattanashetty from Team Bedbugs, and this is PersonaPulse AI.

Content creators today don’t struggle with ideas —
they struggle with adapting one idea across multiple platforms.

The same content needs to sound professional on LinkedIn, casual on Instagram, engaging on Twitter, and structured for blogs.

This manual rewriting is repetitive, inconsistent, and inefficient.

PersonaPulse AI solves this.

0:20 – 0:45 — Problem Statement

The modern creator economy is worth over rs.100 billion.

Yet creators, startups, and students spend hours rewriting the same idea multiple times.

Key challenges:

Platform-specific formatting

Tone adaptation

Audience targeting

Engagement optimization

Traditional tools generate text.

They don’t intelligently personalize it.

We needed something smarter.

 0:45 – 1:20 — Solution Overview

PersonaPulse AI is an AI-powered multi-platform content personalization engine.

The user enters:

A core idea

Platform

Audience

Tone

The system generates structured output:

Hook

Content

Call to Action

Hashtags

Engagement Score

All powered by Amazon Bedrock.

This isn’t just text generation.

It’s AI-driven content optimization.

1:20 – 1:50 — Technical Architecture

Let me briefly explain how it works.

The frontend is built using React.

When the user clicks Generate:

A request is sent to Amazon API Gateway

API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function

Lambda constructs a structured prompt

Amazon Bedrock (Nova Micro) generates optimized content

Lambda parses structured JSON

The frontend renders platform-ready content

The entire system is fully serverless and auto-scaling.

All automatically personalized.

 2:15 – 2:35 — Why This Is Meaningful AI

This solution demonstrates meaningful AI usage because:

It performs semantic understanding

Applies contextual tone transformation

Enforces structured JSON output

Supports scalable serverless architecture

This is not rule-based logic.

It uses generative AI intelligently.

 2:35 – 2:50 — Impact & Scalability

PersonaPulse AI can be used by:

Students
